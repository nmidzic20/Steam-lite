# Steam-lite
Project for university course Databases 2, a system inspired by Steam to shop for and manage video games.

This project describes an envisioned system for digital distribution of video games and the ERA model for such a system, as well as demonstrates its implementation in the MySQL DBMS and the MySQL Workbench database modeling and administration tool. Triggers and complex queries are used in the database implementation, forms are created using PHP in combination with HTML and CSS, and the local server XAMPP is used for communication with this MySQL database. Through the forms, adding a new game to the distribution system, adding and deleting an existing game from a user's wishlist, and trigger operation when modifying data in the wishlist are demonstrated. The forms also display information from the database to the user using complex queries.
